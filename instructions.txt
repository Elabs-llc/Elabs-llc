How to Install and Manage Your VPN Service
Your C++ VPN core is now a Windows Service. You can't just run the .exe file directly. You must install it so that Windows knows how to manage it.

Run all commands from an Administrator Command Prompt.

1. Compile the Code
Compile the new vpn_service.cpp file using the command provided in the code comments. This will create vpn_service.exe.

2. Install the Service
Place the compiled vpn_service.exe in a permanent location, for example C:\MyVPN\. Then, run the following command to install it. The binPath must be the full path to your executable.

sc create MyVPNService binPath= "C:\MyVPN\vpn_service.exe"

If it's successful, you will see [SC] CreateService SUCCESS.

3. Place the Config File
In the same directory as your .exe (C:\MyVPN\), create a file named config.ini. Your Python UI will manage this file automatically, but for testing, you can create it manually with this content:

[Credentials]
Username=user
Password=pass

4. Control the Service
You can now start and stop your service just like any other Windows service.

To Start: sc start MyVPNService

To Stop: sc stop MyVPNService

To Check Status: sc query MyVPNService

5. Check the Logs
The service cannot print to the console. Instead, it logs its activity to C:\vpn_log.txt. If the service fails to start, check this file for error messages.

6. Uninstall the Service
If you need to update the executable or remove the service, you must first stop it and then delete it.

sc stop MyVPNService
sc delete MyVPNService
